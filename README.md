Q) Suppose you are an ethical hacker and you are asked to perform a scan on your simulated
network. Your task is to identify a) live hosts, b) services running on live hosts, c) banner grabbing
d) OS fingerprinting e) conducting performance scans based on your current network bandwidth.
Use any open-source software to generate a report on the same.

-> I have used nmap tool to perform the given question.

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

Nmap allows you to scan your network and discover not only everything connected to it, but also a wide variety of information about whats connected, what services each host is operating and so on.

Nmap can be used by hackers to gain access to uncontrolled ports on the network that may lead to providing access to the system.
